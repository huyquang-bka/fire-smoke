# Fire-Smoke-Detection: An Image Dataset for Fire and Smoke Detection

**Authors:** Bkaitech Team

## About

Fire-Smoke-Detection is an image dataset of fire and smoke occurrences designed for machine learning and object detection algorithms, containing more than
100,000 images.

- **Number of Images by Category:**

  - Only fire: 11,372 images
  - Only smoke: 23,336 images
  - Fire and smoke: 20,140 images
  - Negative: 39,117 images

- **Number of Bounding Boxes by Class:**

  - Fire: 71,292 bounding boxes
  - Smoke: 53,010 bounding boxes

All images were annotated in the YOLOv5 format with normalized coordinates between 0 and 1.
