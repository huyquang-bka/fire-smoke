# Fire-Smoke-Detection: An Image Dataset for Fire and Smoke Detection

**Authors:** Nguyen Huy Quang

## About

Fire-Smoke-Detection is an image dataset of fire and smoke occurrences designed for machine learning and object detection algorithms, containing more than
100.000 images.

- **Number of Images by Category:**

  - Only fire: 1,164 images
  - Only smoke: 5,867 images
  - Fire and smoke: 4,658 images
  - None: 9,838 images

- **Number of Bounding Boxes by Class:**

  - Fire: 14,692 bounding boxes
  - Smoke: 11,865 bounding boxes

All images were annotated in the YOLOv5 format with normalized coordinates between 0 and 1.
