# Fire-Smoke-Detection: An Image Dataset for Fire and Smoke Detection

**Authors:** Bkaitech Team

## About

Fire-Smoke-Detection is an image dataset of fire and smoke occurrences designed for machine learning and object detection algorithms, containing more than
100,000 images.

- **Number of Images by Category:**

  - Only fire: xxx,xxx images
  - Only smoke: xxx,xxx images
  - Fire and smoke: xxx,xxx images
  - None: xxx,xxx images

- **Number of Bounding Boxes by Class:**

  - Fire: xxx,xxx bounding boxes
  - Smoke: xxx,xxx bounding boxes

All images were annotated in the YOLOv5 format with normalized coordinates between 0 and 1.
